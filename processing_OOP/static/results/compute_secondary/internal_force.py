class ComputeInternalForce:
    """
    Computes the internal (nodal) force vector F_int for a finite element.

    This vector is often referred to as the **element nodal internal force vector** because
    it expresses the internal forces the element "pushes back with" at its nodes in response
    to deformation. It is computed via:

        F_int = K_e @ U_e

    where:
        - K_e is the element stiffness matrix
        - U_e is the element nodal displacement vector

    These internal nodal forces are **virtual reaction forces** that, when assembled globally,
    enforce global equilibrium:

        âˆ‘_e (K_e @ U_e) = F_ext

    While the vector has a nodal structure, its values represent **stress-resultants** derived
    from the strain-displacement matrix and constitutive behavior. They capture how the material
    and geometry resist external loads in terms of nodal degrees of freedom.
